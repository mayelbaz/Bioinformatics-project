Identifying Crohn’s disease related mutations using bioinformatics tools, ML and AI in Python
Nov 2018 – Mar 2019

Project descriptionTo predict if a patient is sick from its genotype, we’ve built a classifier from ID3 algorithm under different parameters tuning, to the genotype data related to the disease.
The data is a vcf file containing the genotype of a large number of patients, sick or healthy.
Use of pandas and NumPy packages in order to parse the data and use it.
sklearn package to use the ID3 algorithm and a few other learning methods.
Transformation and filtering of the data in different ways, while keeping the best result marked for the learning algorithm .
Biological analyzation of the genes that were used by our classifier with genome browsers such as USCS.
